Purpose: This is a JavaScipt project that allows you to hover your mouse over a sketch board, allowing you to create sketches or drawings.

What I learned:
In this project, I greatly enhanced my DOM manipulation skills which allowed me to get a good grasp on how to add, change, and remove different elements and properties within my program. Furthermore, I improved my knowledge on HTML and CSS and how the Grid Layout worked and functioned.
